In the competitive world of online grocery delivery, understanding sales trends and consumer behavior is crucial for companies like Blinkit. This project aims to analyze Blinkit's sales data to gain insights into customer preferences, sales patterns, and potential areas for growth. Key questions include:

Which products are performing well, and which are underperforming? Are there any seasonal trends or time-based spikes in sales? What is the overall revenue distribution by category, location, or customer segment? The objective of this analysis is to identify actionable insights that can inform marketing strategies, inventory management, and customer engagement.
